# Face-detection-research-project
Implement a human detection system by utilising Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor with a SVM classifier

# SVM
the file SVM.py includes the HOG implementaion and SVM implementation

# GUI
Call the gui.py main function to run the GUI
The SVM trained model is in the file folder "Others", called svm_model.joblib
To retrain the model you need the sample_data which is not contained in this repository.
The result is saved as prediction.xlsx.
